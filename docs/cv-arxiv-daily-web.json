Continual pre-training (CPT) enhances LLM capabilities by imbuing new domain-specific or proprietary knowledge while replaying general corpus to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The data mixture ratio of general corpus and domain-specific corpus, however, has been chosen heuristically, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency in practice. In this context, we attempt to re-visit the scaling behavior of LLMs under the hood of CPT, and discover a power-law relationship between loss, mixture ratio, and training tokens scale. We formalize the trade-off between general and domain-specific capabilities, leading to a well-defined Critical Mixture Ratio (CMR) of general and domain data. By striking the balance, CMR maintains the model's general ability and achieves the desired domain transfer, ensuring the highest utilization of available resources. Therefore, if we value the balance between efficiency and effectiveness, CMR can be consider as the optimal mixture ratio.Through extensive experiments, we ascertain the predictability of CMR, and propose CMR scaling law and have substantiated its generalization. These findings offer practical guidelines for optimizing LLM training in specialized domains, ensuring both general and domain-specific performance while efficiently managing training resources.**|\n", "2407.17453": "|**2024-07-24**|**$VILA^2$: VILA Augmented VILA**|Yunhao Fang et.al.|[2407.17453](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17453)|null|**Visual language models (VLMs) have rapidly progressed, driven by the success of large language models (LLMs).

We propose to personalize the image generation process by first capturing the generic preferences of the user in a one-time process by inviting them to comment on a small selection of images, explaining why they like or dislike each. Based on these comments, we infer a user's structured liked and disliked visual attributes, i.e., their visual preference, using a large language model. These attributes are used to guide a text-to-image model toward producing images that are tuned towards the individual user's visual preference.

We reveal that while LoRA employs low-rank approximation, it neglects to approximate the optimization process of full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a novel concept called the \"equivalent gradient.\" This virtual gradient makes the optimization process on the re-parameterized matrix equivalent to LoRA, which can be used to quantify the differences between LoRA and full fine-tuning. The equivalent gradient is derived from the gradients of matrices $A$ and $B$. To narrow the performance gap, our approach minimizes the differences between the equivalent gradient and the gradient obtained from full fine-tuning during the optimization process.

Our approach prescribes an iterative fine-tuning procedure, which attempts to teach the model how to alter its response after having executed previously unsuccessful attempts to solve a hard test-time problem, with optionally additional environment feedback. RISE poses fine-tuning for a single-turn prompt as solving a multi-turn Markov decision process (MDP), where the initial state is the prompt. Inspired by principles in online imitation learning and reinforcement learning, we propose strategies for multi-turn data collection and training so as to imbue an LLM with the capability to recursively detect and correct its previous mistakes in subsequent iterations. Our experiments show that RISE enables Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral models to improve themselves with more turns on math reasoning tasks, outperforming several single-turn strategies given an equal amount of inference-time computation.

Additionally, the tightness of these existing bounds depends on the number of IID documents in a training set rather than the much larger number of non-IID constituent tokens, leaving untapped potential for tighter bounds. In this work, we instead use properties of martingales to derive generalization bounds that benefit from the vast number of tokens in LLM training sets. Since a dataset contains far more tokens than documents, our generalization bounds not only tolerate but actually benefit from far less restrictive compression schemes.

As they advertise and sell wildlife products in online marketplaces, they leave digital traces of their activity. This creates a new opportunity: by analyzing these traces, we can obtain insights into how trafficking networks work as well as how they can be disrupted. However, collecting such information is difficult. Online marketplaces sell a very large number of products and identifying ads that actually involve wildlife is a complex task that is hard to automate. Furthermore, given that the volume of data is staggering, we need scalable mechanisms to acquire, filter, and store the ads, as well as to make them available for analysis. In this paper, we present a new approach to collect wildlife trafficking data at scale. We propose a data collection pipeline that combines scoped crawlers for data discovery and acquisition with foundational models and machine learning classifiers to identify relevant ads. We describe a dataset we created using this pipeline which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of its kind: it contains almost a million ads obtained from 41 marketplaces, covering 235 species and 20 languages.

We propose a framework that enables collaboration between AM and AI experts to continuously extract scientific information from data-driven AM literature. A demonstration tool is implemented based on the proposed framework and a case study is conducted to extract information relevant to the datasets, modeling, sensing, and AM system categories.

Using the rendered 3D-aware features, we design a fine-tuning strategy to transfer such 3D awareness into a 2D foundation model. We demonstrate that models fine-tuned in that way produce features that readily improve downstream task performance in semantic segmentation and depth estimation through simple linear probing. Notably, though fined-tuned on a single indoor dataset, the improvement is transferable to a variety of indoor datasets and out-of-domain datasets.

Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: can knowledge editing be used to inject harm into LLMs? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the risk of misinformation injection, we first categorize it into commonsense misinformation injection and long-tail misinformation injection. Then, we find that editing attacks can inject both types of misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness is particularly high for commonsense misinformation injection. For the risk of bias injection, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a high bias increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks, measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical evidence.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements.
